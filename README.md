# Palo Alto Next Generation Firewall & Network Labs

This repository documents a curated set of hands-on labs focused on practical firewall, routing, and network engineering using Palo Alto Networks firewalls in multi-vendor environments.

Labs are executed and validated in an EVE-NG virtual lab environment to simulate real-world network topologies and routing scenarios.

The emphasis is on non-trivial configurations, observable behavior, and validation of outcomes rather than walkthrough-style exercises.
