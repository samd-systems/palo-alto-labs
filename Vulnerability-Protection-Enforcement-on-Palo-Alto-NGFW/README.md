# Lab – Vulnerability Protection Enforcement on Palo Alto NGFW

## Overview
This lab validates how a Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall handles hostile internet traffic aimed at a DMZ server. The focus is on what actually happens to sessions before and after vulnerability protection is turned on, based on session state and firewall logs.

This lab is documented as a validated engineering case note rather than a configuration walkthrough.

## Lab Objectives
- Verify how internet-to-DMZ traffic behaves when only basic allow rules are in place
- Confirm that scan traffic reaches the server when no security inspection is enforced
- Observe firewall behavior after vulnerability protection is enabled
- Validate firewall-driven session drops using session details and logs

## Topology Summary
An internet host simulates an external attacker sending traffic toward a DMZ server. A Palo Alto NGFW sits between the internet and DMZ zones enforcing security policy. This setup allows clear visibility into whether traffic is simply forwarded or actively blocked by the firewall.

## Configuration Summary
- Internet-to-DMZ security rule allowing traffic
- Vulnerability protection profile attached to the rule
- Session and threat logging enabled

(Configuration details intentionally omitted; focus is on behavior and validation.)

## Validation and Results

### Behavior Without the Control
Before vulnerability protection was enabled, scan traffic from the internet was allowed through the firewall. Sessions were created and passed to the DMZ server without any firewall threat action. The server eventually closed the connections on its own, shown by server-side TCP resets and incomplete application identification. No firewall-enforced drops were observed.

### Behavior With the Control
After vulnerability protection was applied, the firewall inspected the same traffic and blocked it inline. Sessions were dropped directly by the firewall, not the server. Session details showed discard states, and the session end reason was logged as a threat-based drop, confirming active firewall enforcement.

## Key Takeaways
- Allow rules alone let scan traffic reach exposed servers
- Vulnerability protection moves enforcement from the server to the firewall
- Firewall session drops provide clear, auditable security outcomes

## Lab Environment
- Palo Alto Networks NGFW (VM-Series)
- Kali Linux attacker host
- DMZ server
- EVE-NG virtual lab platform

## Status
Validated and complete.
